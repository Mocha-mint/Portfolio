        <div class="projectText"><p class="p-10 m-4">Project RAILGUN was a UE5 project developed during my study at Cal State East Bay, in collaboration alongside Katelyn Ang, Emmet Beebe Foley,Â and Yuhtoku Fujikake. It is a short game concept that was conceived to focus upon high speed movement, combined alongside a signature 'Railgun' that one-hit kills any enemy to define the experience loop. Iterating in Unreal Engine, compared to my efforts in 2024 this moved onto a properly structured experience as opposed to loose mechanics.

My role on this project was both as the main programmer on the project, designing and scripting most mechanics and 'backend' systems such as respawns, and I was in general a major creative force throughout.

We began conception with brainstorming various ideas, doing research. I was inspired by the music of 'Hollywood Burns' to attempt a Sci-Fi title, and my particular fun in 'comboing' in ULTRAKILL with its own roster of weapons. The priciple concept guiding this idea, was that by focusing on a weapon that inherently is a one hit kill, we could emphasize our gameplay around continual movement, lining up precise skill shots as you plan your moves in advance. </p></div>
        <div class="projectImg rounded"><img class="profileImg rounded p-4" src="images/railgunImg2.jpg" alt="Early prototype environment in Unreal Engine"></div>
        <div class="projectText"><p class="p-10 m-4">Quickly I was working on our initial prototype, utilizing the 1st Person Template of Unreal for this project. The two primary mechanics to play around with were in consideration to the feel of firing, and how we wanted a 'repositioning' tool to work out. For the Railgun, the goal to focus on a one-hit kill is to enable a high speed gameplay style. The skill mastery should come off improving accuracy as you become adept with maneuvering around lethal projectiles in turn. Since the Railgun would also be your only means of combat, I decided to tie the reload speed to whether or not you actually hit a enemy. This way, you are rewarded for hitting your shots, while the fact you missed a shot will always be noticed for feedback.</p>
            <p class="p-10 m-4">Secondly, for the movement mechanic, keeping things simply with a horizontal 8-way dash worked out best once combined with two more mechanics. While offering the potential for a vertical dash was possible, it began to invalidate other ideas for movement. Not to mention, it made it actually quite unwieldly for most early testing volunteers. Thus, a linear dash that is a consistent relocation tool, that no matter the chaos can be used off muscle memory was ideal. To fully accentuate the Railgun as a powerful feel, players were given not just a second jump, but a mechanic where the Railgun has 'pushback' in the air. Aside from emphasizing the power of the signature weapon, this opened up new opportunities for platforming, and can be used in combat as an evasion tool...at risky of falling into a pit.</p>
            <p class="p-10 m-4">Formative Playtesting was carried out in April 2025, testing with five individuals over an online platform. Minimal aesthetic and material work had been done, this stage was all about getting feedback on the simple gameplay feel of a full level. Results from this playtesting session highlighted a few areas which were addressed over the remaining time of development this project. One thing noted by Josh was that many would just barely fail to land on a ledge, so to compensate a slight 'ledge grab' ability was added to ease something players may not have clear view on when navigating. The difficulty was noted to be high, owing to the enemy melee enemies forcing players to very quickly get comfortable with the movement.</p></div>

            <div class="projectText"><p class="p-10 m-4">Amongst the suite of changes in the second version, was the very tools I used to construct encounters in the original project. Functionally, each spawning zone was its own fully unique blueprint with the spawns hardcoded to respond to the player entering bounds. While it functioned, it created problems on the backend in tweaking design as code had to be rewritten to even move an enemy one inch. As such, this was the first update to the Project in a backend tool, utilizing a more sophisticated modular set of a Spawn Node and Spawn Boundary. With a dropdown list of variables to change, this first change quickly changed the time to update an encounter in response to testing from many minutes to few seconds.</p>

            <div class="projectText"><p class="p-10 m-4">With a reworking of the map, the project entered its final version, implementing changes in response to feedback alongside another art pass. The map was reworked into a new layout, making heavier use of model sculpting. To address the concerns over melee enemies, they were given a wind-up before properly dealing damage while moving faster to compensate. An additional option to utilize a 'melee' punch was added, though kept slow as to not replace the Railgun instead meant to weave with it in combat.</p>
