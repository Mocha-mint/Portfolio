        <div class="projectText"><p class="p-10 m-4">Melting Dream was a project developed during my study at Cal State East Bay, in collaboration alongside Anna Godfrey, and Alan Garcia. Designed to work with a physical control board, this game concept was built around having players get immersed into carefully keeping out an abomination from their location.</p>

        <p class="p-10 m-4">My role on this project was as the main programmer on the project, compiling visual assets drawn by Alan, while Anna handled fabrication of the physical board aspect of the project and its feel.</p>

        <p class="p-10 m-4">The prompt for this project was to have a physical interface guide the design, and under those restrictions the idea for a control board spawned during group brainstorming. The idea developed to be an experience where you control the security of a abandoned facility, after accidentally waking the danger within.</p></div>
        <div class="projectImg rounded"><img class="profileImg rounded p-4" src="images/meltingEarly.png" alt="Picture of laptop, sketches, and early makeymakey board on table."><p class="p-10 fst-italic imgText">Our early process involved plenty of sketching and toying with wires.</p></div>
        <div class="projectText"><p class="p-10 m-4">To keep users engaged physically, you would control buttons on the physical interface to manipulate doors and vents. A late game event forces players to further open up the case, to 'fix' an electrical fault, presented to a group of 24+ students as the final project of its associated course.</p>
