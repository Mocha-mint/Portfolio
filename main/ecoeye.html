        <div class="projectText"><p class="p-10 m-4">EcoEye was developed as a response to a prompt to make an augmented reality application that serves Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13 from the United Nations, while targeting a college demographic. My team would up designing for SDG 13, Urgent Climate Action. As our initial surveys and interviews to gather data illustrated, many students while caring faced an immense informational barrier.</p></div>
        <div class="projectImg rounded"><img class="profileImg rounded p-4" src="images/research.png" alt="Data from research findings"><p class="p-10 fst-italic imgText">Various data from research findings.</p></div>
        <div class="projectText"><p class="p-10 m-4">Something that immediately became apparent when faced with fellow universities, was that the location we polled from simply was not the forward climate advocate many thought it was. In considering what we could develop that could have a tangible benefit, talking this informational problem for busy students, we came to the idea of EcoEye to meet their needs.</p></div>
        <div class="projectImg rounded"><img class="profileImg rounded p-4" src="images/introducing.png" alt="Data from research findings"><p class="p-10 fst-italic imgText">Introductory slide made for physical presentation.</p></div>
        <div class="projectText"><p class="p-10 m-4">EcoEye is an application meant to work seamlessly with a shopping trip, looking at an item puts a 'pin' on it. When this pin is pulled, background information regarding the industry and brand of a product pulls up to help guide users in a value decision.</p></div>
        <div class="projectImg rounded"><img class="profileImg rounded p-4" src="images/testing.png" alt="Data from research findings"><p class="p-10 fst-italic imgText">Concept image created in AR space.</p></div>
        <div class="projectText"><p class="p-10 m-4">A prototype was made mapped to a single object, in order to run some early tests on user gesture preferences. Some feedback immediately taken was that the informational screens should be capable of expansion, while others commented on the UI. These all present interesting opportunities for a future iteration of this project built in more depth if the drive is found. For now though, EcoEye represents an interesting journey in design, trying to find a real problem to solve.</p></div>
